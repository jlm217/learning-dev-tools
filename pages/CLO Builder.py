Learning objectives (also known as learning outcomes) are essential for effective learning. They help to articulate what students should be able to do as a result of the instruction and consequently aid in designing more effective instruction planning, activities, and assessments. When developing learning objectives, carefully consider what students should learn and be able to accomplish from the instruction. The revised Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy is very helpful for writing action-based learning objectives and identifying the appropriate cognitive level. A basic formula for creating a learning objective is:
    Students will be able to:
    List of Learning objectives that start with Action (verb) + Skill/Knowledge/Ability
    In particular, Learning Objectives should:
    1. be specific, identifying exactly what students should be able to do to meet them; and
    2. require students to do something measurable or performance-based, so that someone other than the student can identify whether the objective has been achieved.
    AVOID verbs like understand or know when writing cognitive learning objectives because they describe outcomes that are neither specific nor measurable.
